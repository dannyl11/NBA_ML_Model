After the first round of testing, in which the model was 11/33 on picks for a loss of 4.8 units, I adjusted the weight of features, especially the Home/Away feature which was too heavily accounted for in the model. Whlie scikit-learn doesn't have built-in weighing I artificially weighted features by changing their coefficients. Currently, version 2 of the model has been correct 14/33 times for a gain of 2.8 units. Over the same period, flipping a coin would have correctly guessed 18/33 for a loss of 0.5 units. The inconsistency in the model's performance may be attributed to the model being too simple to capture the complexity of patterns in the data."
